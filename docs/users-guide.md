### What is Metabase?
Metabase is an open source business intelligence server.  

It lets you ask questions based on your own data.  Answers are displayed in formats that make sense, whether that's a bar graph or a detailed table.  

You can mark your questions to be saved for later, so you can come back to them.  Or you can group your questions into visual dashboards.  It's easy to share your questions and dashboards with the rest of your team. 

### A Short Overview of Databases
Before we jump into working with Metabase, it's useful to go over a few key database terms we will use. 

A database is a **collection of tables**.

#### Tables
Tables contain one or more **columns** and one or more **rows**. 
A row is made up of cells and each cell has a value that corresponds to the column it falls under.  

Here's an example of a table:

| Name| Age |
| ---- | --- |
| John | 25 |
| Jenny | 31 |

Here the columns would be `Name` and `Age`. The first row would contain two cells, one with `John` and one with `25`

#### Columns
All the cells in a column contain the same type of information.  For example, in the sample table above, the `Name` column contains names in each cell, while the `Age` column lists ages.  

Each field has a type that describes what kind of data is stored in the field.

Examples of types:

* **String Types** (TEXT, CHAR, VCHAR, etc)  - These fields store things like names, addresses, or anything else that is free text.

* **Numerical Types** (Integer, Float, DoubleFloat, Decimal, etc) - These fields store numbers. Integers are whole numbers; Floats and Decimals are ways to store numbers with decimals in them. Numerical types store things like age, bank account balances, costs, latitudes, and longitudes, to name a few.

* **Time Types** (Timestamp, etc) - These fields are a special format of a number used to store dates and times (or both). Sometimes databases store an integer timestamp which is either seconds or milliseconds, such as `00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970`. This convention  allows for compact storage of timestamps. 
* **IDs** (Also called **primary keys**) - This field uniquely identifies each row.  For example, imagine a car reservation app where you can book a car in advance.  The ID of the reservation could be the reservation number (no two reservations would share the same reservation number, making the ID unique).  

**Customer**

| ID | Name| Age |  
| ---- | --- | --- |
| 11| John | 25 |
| 12| Jenny | 31 |

In the above table, the `ID` field is an ID (primary key). The `Name` field is a string type and the `Age` field is a numerical type (specifically an Integer).   

#### Relationships
Tables can contain references to other tables. 

For example, in our hypothetical car booking app, we would have two tables, one for reservations (let's call it `Reservation`) and one for customers, (we'll call this one `Customer`).  

To connect the reservation data to the corresponding customer data, you can use a `Foreign Key`.  A **`Foreign Key`** is a field used in databases when the contents of its field are the same value as the ID value of a connected row in the other table. 
 
For example, in our hypothetical car booking app, we could connect each reservation to the customer that made the reservation by having the `Customer` column of the reservation contain the same value as the `ID` column of the customer who made the reservation.

**Reservation**

| ID| Customer | Time   
| ---- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 11 | 12/20/2015 |
| 2 | 12 | 1/2/2016

**Customer**

| ID | Name| Age |  
| ---- | --- | ---| 
| 11| John | 25 |
| 12| Jenny | 31 |

If we wanted to analyze our hypothetical app's database with Metabase, we could ask a question, like: 

-- Example of a join --

### Questions
Metabase's two core concepts are questions and their corresponding answers.  Everything else is based around this functionality.
Questions are made up of a number of parts:

* **Source Data** - Source data comes from a table in your database.  Typically, users use a single table from their database as the starting point for their questions.  

* **Optional Filters** - Filters narrow down the source data to an interesting subset, like "active users" or "bookings after June 15th, 2015"
* **View** - There are a few ways to view the answer to your question
	* *Bare rows* are an output of each individual record that matches the criteria of your question.
	* *Aggregation Clause* allows you to ask Metabase to aggregate a question's answer in a particular way, such as taking the sum, average, or total count of values.  
	* *Group* data by a particular field of your table.  
	
* **Advanced Options**
	* Limit your results to 1, 10,1000 or more entries
	* Sort by a column: either by clicking on the column header or by selecting the column in the advanced section

Answers to questions can be visualized in a number of ways:

* Scalar
* Table
* Charts
* Maps

Once a question is answered, you can save, favorite, or download the answer. 

### Dashboards
A **dashboard** displays groups of questions and their corresponding answers.  Each question is on its own card that you can move or resize as you see fit.  

Have a few key performance indicators that you want to be able to easily check?  Make a dashboard featuring questions that show your key metrics and share it with your team.  

You can make as many dashboards as you want.  Keep them private or share them with others on your team.

## Asking Questions

### Raw Data: 
Raw Data is a table with the answer listed in rows.  It's useful when you want to see the actual data you're working with (rather than an aggregate sum) or when you're exploring a small table with a limited number of records.  

Apply filters to see segments of interesting users, venues, or groups, etc. You can save these segments and share them with your team.  

### Different Kinds of Metrics
What's a *metric*? It's a number that is derived from your source table and takes into consideration any filters or elements you asked Metabase to apply to your question.  

#### Basic Metrics
* **Count:** Total of number of rows in the answer.  Each row corresponds to a separate record.

* **Sum:** Sum of all the values in a column
* **Average:** Average of all the values in a column

#### Advanced Metrics
* **Number of Distinct Values:** Number of a column's unique values among all the rows in the answer (Ex. number of different types of items sold in storeâ€”*not to be confused with the total number of items sold*)

* **Cumulative Sum:** Additive sum of all the columns (Ex. total revenue over time)
* **Standard Deviation:** Number which expresses how much the values of a column vary among all rows in the answer

### Breaking Out Metrics
Metrics are a single number. Often you'll want to know more detailed information. 

For example, the sum of all invoiced amounts is a metric.  It's natural to want to look at this metric across time or another dimension, such as whether the invoices are paid or not. 

You can do this by adding a **Group** element to your question.  You can break out your answer by any date or time dimension in your table, as well as any category field. 

If you apply a *single dimension* to your question, you get a table where the leftmost column is the dimension and the rightmost column is the value of the metric for that dimension's value.
*Two dimension* breakouts are equivalent to a pivot table in Excel and are one of the workhorses of the business intelligence world.
If you break out by additional dimensions, you will add columns to the left of the dimension.

### Filtering your Data

You can filter your data by any fields in the table you're working with or any connected tables through foreign keys. 
Different fields can have different filters based on them.
There are four universal filters that can be applied to any field.  These filters are:

* *is a value,* eg. "Status is 'closed'"
* *is not a value* eg. "Status is not 'closed'"
* *is null*, i.e. it isn't set in the record
* *is not null*

Some fields have a limited number of possible filters. Metabase will pick up on this and limit the choices in the filter selection to only valid values.
Some fields (eg. price) will have many possible filters.

Fields that are comparable, like numbers or dates, can also be filtered using the following operators:

* *Less than* a value you enter
* *Greater than* a value you enter
* *Between* two values you enter

If filtering by dates, a datepicker will appear to allow you to input dates easily.	

## Digging into Individual Records

Click on a record's ID to see more information about a given person, venue, etc.  You can see all fields related to that ID and all connected tables that are hidden for readability in the standard dispaly.  

## Asking more Advanced Questions in SQL

If you ever need to ask questions that can't be expressed  using our interactive GUI (guided user interface) query builder, you can use **SQL**.

*What's SQL?* 

* SQL (pronounced "sequel") is short for Structured Query Language and is a widely used standard for getting data from databases. To learn more about it read: [SQL Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)

Even if you don't understand SQL or how to use it, it's worthwhile to understand how to use it inside Metabase because sometimes other people will share SQL based questions that are useful to you.
###Using SQL
* You can switch a card from GUI mode to SQL mode by clicking on the cursor icon in the upper right hand corner.  
* You can write SQL directly into the text box that appears.
* To try it out, type the command `select count(*), date from purchases group by date`. Don't worry if you don't understand this just yet. Click 'run query' and note the table that comes back is the same as if you had graphed "count" broken out by "date". 

Questions asked using SQL can be saved, downloaded, or added to a dashboard just like questions asked using the GUI.

## Visualizing results
While tables are useful for looking up information or finding specific numbers, it's usually easier to see trends and make sense of data overall using graphs.

Metabase offers a number of charting options:
### Line Graphs
### Area Graphs
### Bar & Pie Graphs

### Maps
Metabase offers three different map visuals:
### United States Map
* default GeoJSON
* Creating a map of the United States from your database requires there to be a column with states
* State names will be abbrievated or appear in full 

### Country Maps
* default GeoJSON
* requires a column that is a country in the result
* Countries will appear as full names or abbreviations

### Pin Maps
* requires your admin to set up a google maps api key
* requires both a latitude and a longitude marked column in the result
* heat maps vs pin maps

##Saving Questions & Dashboards
---
##How to Save a Question

##What is a dashboard?
A **dashboard** is a collection of saved questions that you want to refer back to regularly.  Questions on a dashboard are meant to be consumed together.  For example, you could have a dashboard devoted to metrics about the number of reservations.  It could show the number of reservations by day of week, time of day, geographical region, and more.  

You can have as many dashboards as you want.  **Public dashboards** (public only to those within your organization!) can show canonical KPIs that your whole team regularly checks in on.  Use your **personal dashboards** for projects or for keeping track of your own areas of interest.

##How to Arrange Dashboards
To make changes to a dashboard, clicking **Edit** will allow you to resize, reorder, or remove individual question cards.  

* To resize a card, click on its borders.  You can also use the handle in the lower right corner, which will let you drag your cursor to resize the card.  
* To reorder your cards, click and drag the card to where you want it to be.  Other cards will rearrange as you move the card to its new place to make room for it.  
* To remove a question card, click the **X** icon on the card.  

##How to Delete a Dashboard
Deleting a dashboard does not delete the individual question cards on a dashboard.  The question cards will still be saved.  Deleting a dashboard deletes the grouping of the questions (but not the questions themselves).  Be careful when deleting public dashboards - make sure other users in your organization do not need the dashboard.

##Tips on Creating Helpful Dashboards
To make a dashboard that is actually helpful, decide what you want the dashboard to tell you about your data.  What questions will give you insight into what you want to know?  

Once you know what questions you want to know the answer to, make a question card for each question and save them.  Then save the cards to the dashboard.  Once you have the cards you want, structure the cards so that users can easily consume the information.  Place the most important cards near the top of the dashboard or make them bigger than the other cards.  Doing so, will naturally draw users' attention to the cards.

If you have more than 10 cards on a dashboard, consider breaking the dashboard into two separate ones.  You don't want to overwhelm users with too much information and each dashboard should revolve around one theme.  Remember you can make as many dashboards as you want - there's no limit!
