## Administration Guide

Are you in charge of managing Metabase for your organization? Then you're in the right spot. You are the chosen one.
**This guide will teach you how to:**

* [Connect Metabase to databases in your organization](01-managing-databases.md)
* [Enable features that send email (SMTP)](02-setting-up-email.md)
* [Edit your data model](03-data-model.md)
* [Manage user accounts](04-managing-users.md)
* [Configure settings](06-configuration-settings.md)

But first, you'll need to install a copy of Metabase if you haven’t already. Our [Installation Guide](../operations-guide/start.md#installing-metabase) will help you through the process.

Already done with that? Then let’s start with going over [connecting Metabase to your database](01-managing-databases.md).
