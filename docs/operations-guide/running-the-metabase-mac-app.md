# Running the Metabase Mac Application

The Mac Application is the easiest way to setup Metabase locally on Mac OS X for personal use.  Note that currently the Mac Application is not setup for shared use, so some Metabase features which involve the rest of your team won't be possible.

### Installing the Mac Application

Start off by downloading the [Metabase Mac Application binary](http://www.metabase.com/start/mac.html) if you haven't done so already.  Once the download is complete go ahead and double click the file to open the installer.  You should see something like this:

Next simply click and drag the Metabase icon over to the Applications Folder icon.  That will install Metabase into your main Applications folder.


### Launching Metabase

To launch Metabase open the Mac Finder application and click on Applications on the left.  Then scroll down your applications list until you see Metabase.app and double click on it.

The Metabase application should now have opened and you should see the loading screen in the application window.

Give the application a moment to finish initializing and then you should see the screen change to the Metabase Welcome page.  That's it!  Installation Complete.

Now that you’ve installed Metabase, it’s time to [set it up and connect it to your database](/docs/setting-up-metabase.md).
