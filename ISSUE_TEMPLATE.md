When you open an issue, it would be super helpful if you could include the following information, if relevant: :100:
- [ ] What browser are you using? (Or are you using the Mac App?)
- [ ] What OS are you using?
- [ ] What version of Metabase are you using?
- [ ] What database are you using?
 
Thanks! Luv, Team Metabase :heart_eyes_cat:
