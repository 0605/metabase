# - Because GA metrics all have a time dimension, it would be great if GA auto-dashboards included a date filter widget, maybe defaulting to Last 30 Days
# - Observation: whether or not you care about things like traffic sources, session dollar value, ad referral etc. really depends on if youâ€™re e-comm, blog/news/marketing website, or a web app.

# *Probably interesting charts:*
# x - Sessions over time broken out by new vs. returning users (maybe a stacked area chart)
# x - Sessions by country (or state?)
# x - Sessions over time by device type: desktop vs. mobile vs. tablet
# x - Daily active users over time
# x - Pages with most pageviews (horizontal bar chart, pageviews broken out by pagePath)
# x - Top landing pages (table of sessions by landing page)
# x - Top traffic sources (sessions by top channels) and referral pages (sessions by source)
# ????- Cohort retention chart
